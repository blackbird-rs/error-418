  stateText: "Hello!\r\n\nI know you must have a lot of questions. \r\nWhere am I?
    \r\nWho is this text that's talking to me? \r\nWhy am I a QR code to a subpar
    video game repository?\n\nThose are all valid questions, and they shall be answered
    in time. \r\nBut to find the answers, you must walk the path of enlightment.
    \r\nAnd to do that you need to chose. \r\n\nThe white pill, or the green pill.\r\n\nWhat...
    You were expecting red and blue pills? \r\nWell, it's kinda copywritten by The
    Matrix, and the whole red pill concept has been ruined by... \r\nYou know what,
    I don't need to explain myself to you.\r\nIt's how I do it, green and white.
    \r\n\nGreen brings you back to your boring life, and white shows you the truth
    down the racoon hatch. \r\n(Again, copywrite, don't get me started).\r\n\nSo,
    what shall it be my monochromatic friend?\r\n\n(W)hite or (G)reen?"
